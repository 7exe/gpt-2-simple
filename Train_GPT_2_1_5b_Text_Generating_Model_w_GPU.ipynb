        "\n",
        "This is a fork of the `gpt-2-simple` implementation of [Max Woolf](http://minimaxir.com). \n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this fork is to leverage the new Tesla P100 GPUs available on Google Colab to enable retraining the GPT-2-1.5b model for free using Collaboratory.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main problem with the original implementation is that it offers only two optimizers, Adam and SGD. \n",
        "\n",
        "Adam is **too memory intensive**, and does not fit in memory. SGD works, but it is a **poor optimizer** and training does not converge.\n",
        "\n",
        "We solve this by implementing an [Adafactor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04235) optimizer, based on the `tensor2tensor` implementation. This solution is more memory efficient than Adam and fits in memory for the P100 GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get started:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Copy this notebook to your Google Drive to keep it and save your changes. (File -> Save a Copy in Drive)\n",
